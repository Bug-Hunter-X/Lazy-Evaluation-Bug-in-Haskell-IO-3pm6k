This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction between `IO` actions and infinite lists.

```haskell
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  contents <- readFile "input.txt"
  let lines' = lines contents
     filteredLines = filter ("apple" `isPrefixOf`) lines'
     output = unlines filteredLines
  putStrLn output
```

If the `input.txt` file is very large or contains an infinite stream of lines (e.g., produced by another process), the `lines` function will not terminate, leading to the program hanging. This is because `lines` lazily processes the input, and the `filter` operation attempts to evaluate the entire infinite list before printing anything.
